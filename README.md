# About this project

Full-Stack web application demos showing the usage of [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api).
<br/>
We implemented some of the popular payment flows such as [Accepting Online Payments and Creating & Managing Subscriptions](https://stripe.com/docs/payments).
<br/>
We used Vue and Angular for the frontend since there is already a good amount of resources that uses React and pure JavaScript.
